        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This is my mom's special homemade lasagna recipe with a meaty, made-from-scratch tomato sauce and a deliciously cheesy filling. A more traditional homemade lasagna filling would be made with ricotta but my mom's recipe calls for a blend of small-curd cottage cheese and Parmesan. I have found none better anywhere. Serve with a leafy green salad and crusty garlic bread.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Fresh basil</li>
            <li>Garlic</li>
            <li>Tomatoes</li>
            <li>Salt</li>
            <li>Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat and add sliced garlic. Cook and stir for about 30 seconds before adding basil leaves. Sizzle garlic and basil in olive oil until the thinnest slices of garlic just start to turn golden. Quickly transfer in tomatoes. Add salt and pepper flakes and increase heat to medium-high.</li>
            <li>Cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture simmers and the tomatoes have completely collapsed and liquefied. Turn off the heat.</li>
            <li>Using a strainer or colander, strain the sauce into another pot, pressing everything through with the back of a ladle or spatula, until nothing is left in the colander except the skins and seeds.</li>
            <li>Place strained sauce back over medium heat and reduce to about 5 cups, or until desired thickness. Taste for seasoning and use immediately, or store in an airtight container until needed.</li>
            
        </ol>
